# spectral_similarity
Python implementation of provisional SSI

Once unpacked it should be possible to enter the top-level source directory and type:

python ./test_illuminant.py resources/emitters/generic_led_cool.json

This will print a number representing the SSI error for the test spectrum provided.

The test is currently hard-wired to use ISO 7589 Tungsten as the reference illuminant.
